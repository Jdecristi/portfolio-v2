    "description": "At Thumbstopper, I successfully integrated back-end services and server-side logic to create a high-performance platform. I also ensured smooth front-end integration and seamless integration of user-facing elements. Overcoming architectural challenges, I implemented the MVC design patterns and utilized PHP web frameworks to optimize the system's performance. Additionally, I employed front-end technologies like Vue.js and object-oriented PHP programming to enhance the user experience. Furthermore, I efficiently managed and accessed SQL databases to store and retrieve data."
